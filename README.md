# Predictive-Modeling-with-Infrared-Thermography
The investigation aimes to conduct both regression task and classification task on The Infrared Thermography Temperature Dataset.

The overall goal of this project is to develop a model that predict, the oral temperature measured in fast mode and in monitor mode. This involves building different model and finding the most predictive features.

I will assess the model's performance using cross-validation, a robust statistical method that maximizes the use of available data by iteratively splitting the dataset into training and validation subsets. This practice helps in estimating the performance of the model on unseen data, thereby ensuring that the model generalizes well and does not overfit to particular quirks of the training data.

By the end of this investigation, I aim to have a optimal model tuned to offer the highest predictive accuracy on the Infrared Thermography Temperature Dataset. This report will detail the steps taken in the investigation, the implementation of training, evaluation, the results obtained, and discussion.
